## Arduino System Components used for this project.
Arduino Uno R3
Keypad (4x4)
LCD Display (16x2)
Micro Servo Motor
Power Supply

## Working of the System:
The user will enter a predefined password using the keypad.
The Arduino processes the input and compares it with the stored password.
If the password is correct, the servo motor rotates to unlock the door, and an LED display (Correct Password) means confirms access.
If the password is incorrect, the system provides feedback via the LCD as Incorrect Password.
