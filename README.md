## Arduino System Components used for this project.
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Keypad (4x4)
3. LCD Display (16x2)
4. Micro Servo Motor
5. Power Supply

## Working of the System:
* The user will enter a predefined password using the keypad.
* The Arduino processes the input and compares it with the stored password.
* If the password is correct, the servo motor rotates to unlock the door, and an LED display (Correct Password) means confirms access.
* If the password is incorrect, the system provides feedback via the LCD as Incorrect Password.
